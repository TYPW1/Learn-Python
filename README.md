# Learn-Python

This repository contains a collection of Python projects, practice scripts, and small web demos created while learning Python.

The codebase is primarily **Python (~95%)** with a small amount of **HTML** for simple front-end or visualization demos.

---

## 📁 Repository structure

Top-level folders are organized to reflect learning progression and project type:

- `Beginner/` – Introductory exercises and small scripts
- `Intermediate/` – More complex programs and games
- `Projects/` – Larger, self-contained projects and experiments
- `Scripts/` – Assorted utilities, analysis tools, and experiments
- `Data/` – Data files and generated artifacts used by the projects

There are also a few configuration files such as `.devcontainer/`, `.idea/`, and `requirements.txt` to support development.

---

## 🧠 Beginner (`Beginner/`)

Introductory scripts for learning the basics of Python, including:

- Variables, loops, and conditionals  
- Basic functions and scope  
- Simple input/output and user interaction  
- Mini games like **Blackjack** and **Number Guesser**

These files are ideal if you are just starting out and want short, focused examples.

---

## 🚀 Intermediate (`Intermediate/`)

Projects that build on the basics and introduce more advanced concepts such as:

- Object-oriented programming (classes, methods, inheritance)  
- File I/O and working with the filesystem  
- Using standard libraries and a few third-party packages  
- Turtle graphics projects  
- Simple games (e.g. **Pong**, **Snake**)  
- Small OOP apps like a **coffee machine** simulator

These are great for practicing how to structure code, split logic into functions/classes, and work with external libraries.

---

## 🛠️ Larger Projects (`Projects/`)

More self-contained or experimental projects, for example:

- **CosmicRay** – Mutation testing experiments  
- **Flask** – Mini web server / API demos  
- **Summarizer** – NLP and LLM-based summarization utilities  
- **OpenAI** and **Starcoder** – Experiments with AI-assisted code generation

Each project typically lives in its own subfolder with Python entry points and, where relevant, small HTML files for basic UI or output visualization.

---

## 📜 Scripts & Tools (`Scripts/`)

Assorted standalone or categorized scripts, including:

- **AST** – Abstract Syntax Tree parsing and code analysis tools  
- **HumanEval** – Scripts for evaluating LLM-generated code on coding tasks  
- **Misc** – Practice snippets, throwaway experiments, and prototype scripts  

You can use these as references for trying out ideas or testing specific Python features.

---

## 📂 Data & Artifacts (`Data/`)

Supporting files used for experiments and documentation, such as:

- JSON outputs  
- PDF summaries  
- Log files and other generated artifacts  

These are usually produced by the scripts and projects in this repo.

---

## 🧰 Setup

Most projects rely only on common Python libraries. To set up the environment, make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some sub-projects may have their own additional dependencies. Check each project's folder for its own `requirements.txt` or notes in a `README`.

## 🧪 How to use this repo

Here are some suggested ways to use this repository:

1. **Follow the folders in order** – Start in `Beginner/`, move to `Intermediate/`, then explore `Projects/`.
2. **Run and modify examples** – Pick a script or project, run it, then tweak parameters or logic to see what happens.
3. **Use as reference** – Copy patterns (e.g. file I/O, classes, simple games) into your own experiments.
4. **Practice reading code** – Try to explain what a script does before running it, then verify by executing it.

## ✅ Roadmap / Todo

Planned improvements for this learning repo:

- [ ] Add unit tests for core modules and exercises  
- [ ] Improve docstrings and inline comments  
- [ ] Add more advanced projects (APIs, async, data pipelines, small web apps)  
- [ ] Expand HTML-based demos for interactive visualizations  
- [ ] Add more detailed per-folder READMEs and examples
